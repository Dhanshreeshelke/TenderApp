Question 2:There are 144 horses among which we need to find out the fastest 11 horses. In each race, only
12 horses can run simultaneously because there are only 12 tracks. You cannot use a
stopwatch; you only know the finishing order of each race.


Answer : 
Since I can only run 12 horses at a time, I divided the 144 horses into 12 groups of 12.
I ran 1 race for each group — this gave me the ranking inside each group (1st to 12th).

Total races so far: 12 races.

Then I took the 12 winners — one from each group — and raced them together.
This helped me figure out which groups had the fastest horses overall.

 After this, I knew the top 11 winners from this race are potential candidates for the overall top 11.


Total races so far: 12 + 1 = 13 races

Now I thought: maybe the 2nd or 3rd place horses from the groups of these top 11 winners could also be faster than other horses

So from the groups of the top 11 finishers, I also selected their 2nd and 3rd place horses — because they still had a chance to be in the overall top 11

This gave me 33 horses to consider:

11 (from winners race top 11)

22 (2nd & 3rd from those 11 groups)

Finally, I needed to sort these 33 horses to know exactly which 11 are fastest.
Since I can only race 12 horses at a time, I needed 3 more races for this


12 (initial group races) + +1 (winners race) + 3 (final sorting of 33 horses) = 16 races

So Final answer is :16 races will require.

Assumption I made:

1)  I assumed no ties — that every horse can be ranked in each race

2) I treated all initial groups equally — at first, I don’t know which groups are strong or weak.
